# MCMS

Matrix completion method for causal panel data models with data-driven model selection

The __MCMS__ package provides functions to calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET), estimating a low-rank factor model plus noise with a linear covariate term using the matrix completion method. The method uses nuclear norm regularization on the rank of the matrix of unobserved factors and l-1 regularization on the covariate model to simultaneously reduce the model complexity in the covariates.

To install this package in R, run the following commands:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools) 
install_github("heinigersandro/MCMS")
```
